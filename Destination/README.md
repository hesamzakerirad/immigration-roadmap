Ok. This is where we decide where we want to go and make a decent living for ourselves. There are a lot of factors in play that could easily over-whelm us; and this is the reason I came up with a simple system to help us think clearly and make a good decision.

The first thing any one of us should consider, is the quality of life among the top countries in the world, and this is where [OECD Better Life Index](https://www.oecdbetterlifeindex.org/#/55555555555) comes into play. 

By checking the link above you can see all the countries ranked and sorted from best to less-good countries in regards to the quality of life.

At the time of writing this (Jan 2023), Norway is #1 on the list, followed by Iceland, Switzerland and Swedan and so on.

By looking at this picture, you can see that I have already tweaked the indexes to show the best countries first; because I'm a perfectionist man, and I want the best for all my mans out there.

So you should now have a few ideas about the places you could choose to live, and I assume that they might be among the top 10 countries on the list, and those are the ones we're going to check.

I tried to provide good quality content for you; hope you learned a few things and came close to making a decision. 

Now, if you managed to make your decision, the next step is to find yourself a great job. 

Unfortunately, I cannot help you with that; the process is too personal for me to intervene. With that said, I hope to see you in the [interview](/Interview/README.md) section.
