# Resume
It's a no-brainer that a man with a great resume is bound to find a great job. 

In all the time I have searched the web, I have found that the simpler the resume the better. 

The key is to put yourself in the shoes of an HR manager or the person responsible for reviewing your resume; will you read 5 pages of nonsense when you have 100 more resumes to go through? Nope! Not a chance!

This is even true for this very document, would you read a 100-page document on immigration? I know I wouldn't! So that's why I'm keeping things short and simple.

For the sake of keeping things short, I'm not going to give you a long list of videos to watch. This is the only one you need. Watch this, and you'll have a solid understanding of what your resume should be.

Now that you're done with your resume, it's time to move on to the next section.

Do you know where you want to end up? If so move on to the [interview](/Interview/README.md) section; and if you still haven't figured that out, don't worry, I got you covered. Move on to the [destination](/Destination/README.md) section to get started.
