### Disclaimer #1
I am no expert on this! Everything you see is the result of me surfing the web for hundereds of hours and searching for good information, so if there's something wrong, do [open an issue](https://github.com/hesamzakerirad/immigration-roadmap/issues) please.

### Disclaimer #2 
This roadmap is specially prepared for my Iranian mans out there, so if you're not from Iran, some of the information might not be of use to you.

### Disclaimer #3
Immigration process is very over-whelming so I tried to separate each major step into its own category; for example if you only need some tips for making a sharp resume, you can go inside the resume section and enjoy the tips.

### Disclaimer #4
This roadmap is designed based on the fact that you want to immigrate using a work visa; so if anyone wants to immigrate using some other type of visa, this roadmap may not be useful to you.

Ok! Jesus! Enough with all the disclaimers already! Let's get down to business.

Here's the list of major steps in an immigration process. (Note that the order is important!)

- [Preparing a resume](#)
- [Deciding where to go](#)
- [Looking for a position](#)
- [Applying for a position](#)
- [Interview](#)
- [Final Negotiations](#)

And you're done. You're now a man with a plan or a gal with a plan ;)

You now have a clear vision of what your next step is going to be. 

Good luck with building a beautiful life. Hope I helped.

Cheers ðŸ¥‚
