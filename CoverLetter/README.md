# Cover Letter
You may have heard the word "cover letter" in the past and ignored it, it's not going to happen again! 

If you knew the power of a tailored cover letter you wouldn't send another resume without it again!

If I want to illustrate it, I could say that a cover letter to a resume is like Bonnie to Clyde! You who they are, don't you? That famous couple who robbed banks together! Their plans wouldn't have worked it either of them weren't present. 

A job application is exactly like this; you could send only your resume, but you wouldn't have as much luck as you would when you send both of them together; and in this section we're going to talk about cover letters.

Just like the resume section, I'm planning to keep things short and simple; so this is the only video you're going to need.

How are we doing so far? I hope good!

Now that we're done with cover letters, it's time to get a bit more serious.

At this point you're ready to present yourself as a professional and go through your immigration process, but wait, where are you planning to immigrate to?

If you have already figured it out, head over to [interview](/Interview/README.md) section, and if not, let's get started with choosing a nice [destination](/Destination/README.md).
